# LUFT metrics quick reference (preliminary)

- **χ (causality/stability ratio)**: Project-internal, dimensionless ratio used in LUFT scan workflows to flag the onset of causal or stability violations. Current internal analysis places the boundary near χ ≈ 0.15; derivation and normalization are documented in lab notebooks and will be formalized for publication.
- **Zero-violation points**: Sampled parameter combinations that satisfy all LUFT causality and stability checks in the scan workflow. The cited 1.48M+ count refers to the aggregate passing points from the January 2026 internal run.
- **Time-domain harmonics (66 h, 0.9 h)**: Dominant long-period suppression (~66 h) and short-period harmonic (~0.9 h) observed in internal LUFT magnetosphere spectra; both require external replication.

These metrics are preliminary and intended to aid internal traceability. Full methodological details will be added alongside the public release of the LUFT scan workflow.
