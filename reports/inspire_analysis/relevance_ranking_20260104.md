**Top 10 relevance (score 0–1)**

1. **0.95** — *Causality Bounds on Dissipative General-Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics* (Cordeiro et al., PRL 133, 091401, 2024)  
   Necessary/sufficient causality & strong hyperbolicity for relativistic Braginskii MHD with diffusion.
2. **0.92** — *Causality in dissipative relativistic magnetohydrodynamics* (Hoult & Kovtun, JHEP 2025, 9)  
   Linear vs nonlinear causality in viscous MHD with neutral currents; accretion-disk applicability.
3. **0.89** — *Causality and stability of magnetohydrodynamics for an ultrarelativistic locally neutral two-component gas* (arXiv:2505.10397)  
   Linear causality & stability for arbitrary magnetic-field strength; contrasts Israel–Stewart behavior.
4. **0.85** — *Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics in action: effective field theory and holography* (Baggioli et al., JHEP 2025, 126)  
   EFT for chiral fluids with dynamical EM fields and axial anomaly.
5. **0.82** — *A systematic formulation of chiral anomalous magnetohydrodynamics* (Landry & Liu, 2022/updated 2025)  
   Chiral magnetic/separation effects with dynamical fields; chiral magnetic wave survival.
6–10. **0.78–0.65** — Magnetized QGP evolution, anisotropic viscosities, higher-order dissipative anisotropic MHD, relativistic MHD in the early universe, minimal-energy states in chiral MHD turbulence.

**Key interpretation**

- No prior claims of a universal **χ ≈ 0.15** causality/stability boundary were found; χ is the project-internal dimensionless LUFT causality/stability ratio from the scan workflow (see `docs/internal_metrics.md`; external replication pending).
- 2024–2025 causality papers provide theoretical bounds that the LUFT dataset can test empirically (1.48M+ zero-violation points—parameter combinations satisfying causality/stability constraints—in preliminary internal runs; zero-violation definition in `docs/internal_metrics.md`, workflow publication pending).
- Chiral/anomalous MHD literature (2025) aligns qualitatively with the LUFT signals (66 h suppression of long-period power and 0.9 h short-period harmonics in internal magnetosphere spectra); this is a preliminary cross-scale link requiring validation.
