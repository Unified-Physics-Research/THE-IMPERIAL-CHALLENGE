The data set encompasses all waveform observations obtained in the cruise mission phases before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases as well as those obtained during the two encounter phases.  These measurements were acquired from the PWS waveform receiver. Data are presented as time series of 4-bit voltage measurements acquired at the rate of 28,800 samples per second through a 40 Hz to 12 kHz bandpass filter.  This data set provides the highest temporal resolution data from the Voyager mission.                       3     M            An automatic gain control is used to keep the signal within the usable range of the 4-bit digitization, however, the gain information is not returned to the ground, hence, there is no direct, absolute calibration.  However, a power spectrum analysis returns a spectrum that has accurate relative amplitudes between spectral elements. In order to prevent an artifical DC component from appearing in generated spectra and to reduce output file size, the 4-bit values have been multiplied by 2 and added to the value -15.  Thus the data are zero centered and may be stored in CDF_BYTE arrays.      D         1                            .      CATDESC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	      /u      3       L           Calibrated Spacecraft Event Time in UTC of the first capture of the Waveform       y   	      /      3      A           Ground assigned spacecraft clock partition, accounts for rollover       y   	      0g      3      A           Immutable Spacecraft Clock value of first capture of the waveform       {   	      0      3      C           Earth Receive Time of the Waveform, a sanity check for Epoch values       w   	      1Y      3      ?
